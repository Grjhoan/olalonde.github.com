<p>As well all know, Javascript isn&rsquo;t allowed in Posterous themes. Luckily, iframes are and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll use to go around the no Javascript limitation.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DnUlw.png" alt="posterous screenshot" /></p>

<p>Simply go to your Posterous dashboard, click &quot;Settings&quot; on the top right, then click the &quot;Edit Theme&quot; button and select the &quot;Advanced tab&quot;. Now, all you have to do is paste one of the following snippets where you want the button to show up and click the &quot;Save, I&rsquo;m done!&quot; button.</p>

<ul>
<li>Standard button:</li>
</ul>


<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/1003860.js"></script></p>

<ul>
<li>Tall button:</li>
</ul>


<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/1003872.js"></script></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all you have to do to integrate Google +1 to your Posterous.</p>

<p>If you want to host the script yourself, the <a href="https://github.com/olalonde/google-plusone-posterous">source code</a> is available on Github:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>git clone https://olalonde@github.com/olalonde/google-plusone-posterous.git</pre></div>
