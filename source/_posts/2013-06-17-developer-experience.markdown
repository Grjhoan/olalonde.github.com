// alternative title: how to properly fix issues on Github

Here are some personal note on what I should do to make my libraries the
most developer friendly as possible:

- When I have an issue on Github with an error message. 

  - Explain how to fix the problem. 
  - Then, go back in the source code and add an informative error message with a link to the Github issue.

- When a bug is reported:
  - Fix the bug
  - Go back in your tests and write a test case for that error
