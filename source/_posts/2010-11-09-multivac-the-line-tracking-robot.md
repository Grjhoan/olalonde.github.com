<p>Here's a line tracking robot I built with friends at university. I thought I would post it here before it sinks into oblivion. It was built using a 16bit&nbsp;micro-controller (<a href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?PN=ATmega16">ATmega16</a>), a PCB, a small motor and some sensors. The programming was done in C/C++. Source code and hardware (if you can pick it up - Montreal) available <a href="http://twitter.com/olivierll">upon request</a>.</p>

<p>Any ideas of how I could turn it into something useful? I also got a proximity sensor if that can be of any use.</p>
