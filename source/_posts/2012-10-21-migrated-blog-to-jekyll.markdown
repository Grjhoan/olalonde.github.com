I just finished migrating my blog from
[Posterous](http://posterous.com) to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
Posterous was acquired by Twitter a few months ago and is now in
maintenance mode. I'm now hosting this blog for free on
[Github](http://github.com/olalonde/olalonde.github.com) and 
use Octopress/Jekyll to generate the files. So far, it is really a joy to write all
my posts in Markdown. I'm basically blogging from Vim right now (and using the [Hammer plugin](https://github.com/matthias-guenther/hammer.vim) to preview my posts). I wish I had done this move earlier.

    <3 Jekyll + Octopress + Github + Markdown + Vim + Hammer.vim
