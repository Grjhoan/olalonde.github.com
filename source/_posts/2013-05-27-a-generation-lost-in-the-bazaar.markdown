A Generation Lost in the Bazaar

Fascinating discussion on software engineering and programming:

This comment by metageek was my favorite:

```
This is a typical engineering point of view. Engineers like to think that the world could be designed, however Nature shows the opposite. Any sufficiently complex system cannot be built out of design, it has to be *evolved*. Evolution is messy (anarchic?): pieces that work get reused, pieces that do not are lost. There must be something good about autoconf that has enabled it to survive and eliminate those awful "designed" makefiles that needed manual tweeking even though they did not check for 15 different Fortran compilers (the status quo of the 1980s). Does it matter that autoconf looks for those now extinct compilers? No, but it gives it robustness which is why it has survived. Someday a new, less bloated, alternative to autoconf will appear and it will slowly overtake autoconf. In the meantime we are doing very well with it, thank you very much. 

Software is the most complex construction that mankind has so far created. It is so complex that it can only be evolved much like Nature's products are. Engineers can continue living in their nice little artificial world of linear systems and planned devices. Those that venture in the real-world of complexity and are successful will take up Nature's ideas.
