      <p>Only a few weeks ago, there seemed to be absolutely no interest for tech startups in Shenzhen, China (or at least, among the English speaking community). As a startup guy, I was pretty upset by the seemingly&nbsp;nonexistent&nbsp;community. Of course, there was Hong Kong nearby with a <a href='http://www.hksua.com.hk/'>vibrant</a> <a href='http://boot.hk'>community</a> but I wanted something in Shenzhen.&nbsp;I decided I'd prove myself wrong by creating a "<a href='http://www.shenzhenstuff.com/group/startups'>Startups and technology SZ</a>" group on a popular expat social network called <a href='http://ShenzhenStuff.com'>ShenzhenStuff.com</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It turned I was wrong about the lack of interest! The group grew to 32 members within only a few days. Within the same time frame, <a href='http://blog.michaelmichelini.com/'>Michael Michelini</a>, an American expat, and his associates were officially launching a <a href='http://www.szteam.com'>coworking space</a> aimed at web workers and freelancers. Talk about timing! Michael from&nbsp;<a href='http://www.szteam.com'>SZTeam</a>&nbsp;offered to host and run a first "Startup Tuesday" meeting which turned out to be a huge success.</p><p>Michael wrote a nice <a href='http://szteam.com/387'>outline of the event</a>&nbsp;and published <a href='http://szteam.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Shenzhen-Team-Startups-Tuesday.pdf'>his slides</a>. The ~50 (I suck at guesstimates) attendees came from all kinds of backgrounds (technical, business, finance, curious people, etc.) and the crowd was about half foreigners, half Chinese.&nbsp;</p><p /><div><img alt='' src='http://blog.michaelmichelini.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/hugely-successful-shenzhen-startup-meeting-tuesday.jpg' /></div><p /><div>For the upcoming events, many suggestions were made: invite speakers to talk about a specific topic, co-founder "speed dating", startup weekends, pitch nights, etc. I'm particularly interested in co-founder speed dating as I'm <a href='mailto:olalonde@gmail.com'>looking for a co-founder</a> :)</div><p /><div>This first meeting was a huge success and Michael deserves all the credit. I would also&nbsp;recommend <a href='http://www.szteam.com'>SZTeam</a> to freelancers or anyone who is working on a startup. The people are friendly, there is a nice conference room, free coffee and the pricing is pretty cheap: hot desk for 500 RMB/month (80 USD/month) and fixed desk for 1500 RMB/month (235 USD/month).</div><p /><div>
<div>From now on, we will try to gather the community around the <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/shenzhen-startup/subscribe'>Shenzhen Startup</a> mailing list and the <a href='http://www.shenzhenstuff.com/group/startups'>Startups and technology SZ</a> group. <a href='http://www.szteam.com'>SZTeam</a> will continue to host <a href='http://szteam.com/location'>Startup Tuesday</a>&nbsp;every Tuesday 7pm.</div>
</div><p /><div>I think we are on the right path to build a vibrant startup community in Shenzhen!</div>
